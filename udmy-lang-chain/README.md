# LangChain
 - modules (python) / components (javascript)

##### LLM Components
 - model io - focuses on basic LLM I/O (support text completion and chat interface)
 - data connection - connects LLMs to a data source (e.g. vector store / docs)
 - chains - link the output of one model to be the input of another model
 - memory - allows models to retain historical context of previous interactions
 - agents - LLM-based apps that perform complex tasks - group Models, Data Connections, Chains and Memory to reason through requests and perform actions on observational outputs
